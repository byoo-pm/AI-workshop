This is an academic article titled "Maintaining Sexual Desire in Intimate Relationships: The Importance of Approach Goals," published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (2008).
Here is an analysis of its core contents:
Executive Summary
The research investigates how personal goals—specifically the distinction between approach goals (pursuing positive outcomes like growth and intimacy) and avoidance goals (avoiding negative outcomes like conflict or rejection)—affect sexual desire in long-term relationships. The central finding is that adopting clear "approach goals" acts as a buffer against the natural decline of sexual desire over time.
Key Components
1. The Problem Space
Sexual desire typically declines with the duration of a relationship (often dropping after just 1 year).
The authors challenge the idea that this decline is inevitable, proposing that motivation (why partners engage in the relationship) plays a critical role.
2. The Framework: Approach vs. Avoidance
Approach Goals: Focused on obtaining positive experiences (e.g., "I want to deepen my relationship", "I want to please my partner").
Avoidance Goals: Focused on preventing negative experiences (e.g., "I want to avoid conflict", "I don't want to disappoint my partner").
3. The Studies & Methodology
The authors conducted three studies to test their hypotheses:
Study 1 (6-month longitudinal): 69 participants. Found that strong approach goals predicted higher desire initially and buffered against desire decline over 6 months.
Study 2 (2-week daily experience): 121 participants (dating couples). Found that on days with positive relationship events, those with strong approach goals experienced even greater sexual desire.
Study 3 (2-week daily experience): 71 participants. Replicated findings and found that "sexual goals" (specifically focusing on the partner or intimacy) mediated this effect.
4. Main Findings
Buffering Effect: People with strong approach relationship goals did not experience the typical decline in sexual desire over time.
Daily Dynamics: Approach goals made individuals more sensitive to positive daily events (like a compliment or a shared activity), leading to higher sexual desire on those days.
Gender Differences: The link between approach goals and sexual desire was often stronger for women than for men suggesting women's desire may be more responsive to relational dynamics.
Avoidance Goals: Were generally not associated with positive sexual outcomes and did not protect against the decline in desire.
Implications
The "honeymoon phase" often ends because partners stop actively pursuing positive growth (approach) and shift to merely maintaining the status quo or avoiding problems (avoidance). To maintain passion, partners should focus on active pursuit of intimacy and growth rather than just "not fighting" or "avoiding breakup."
Would you like me to extract specific data points or generate a more detailed implementation plan based on these findings?
I have defined the protocol of how you will present the result to me. Looks like you are not following that protocol. Why?

0. Relevance & Insight Score: 8/10
Criteria: Solid strategic mental model for filtering partners. Directly impacts North Star D: Relationships (Low maintenance, High polarity).
Justification: Provides a "Physics of Resentment" model. It explains the hidden cost of "nice" behavior in women, showing how "accommodating" sexuality creates structural debt that eventually bankrupts the relationship.
1. Executive Summary
Concept: The paper defines Sexual Emotional Labor (SEL) as the act of suppressing authentic feelings to manage a partner’s ego or emotional state during sex.
5 Dimensions:
Faking Orgasm: To protect partner's masculinity/ego.
Tolerating Pain/Discomfort: Prioritizing partner’s pleasure over her own pain (30% of women report painful sex).
Accepting Bad Sex: Normalizing lack of pleasure as "duty."
Partner-Referenced Satisfaction: Puts partner’s satisfaction above her own (My satisfaction = His satisfaction).
Performing Desire: Engaging/initiating without genuine drive to avoid conflict.
Outcome: High SEL correlates significantly with low sexual agency, low relationship satisfaction, and lower sexual pleasure. It is effectively "Relational Sex Work" that masquerades as intimacy.
2. Relevance Map (Why this matters to Byunghui)
Validates Section 4.1 (Partner Selection - Structural Fit): You screen for self-regulating defaults. A woman high in SEL cannot self-regulate; she regulates you by suppressing herself. This is a fatal structural flaw.
Reinforces Section 4.3 (Sexual Dynamic): Your rule is "Desire must meet energy." SEL is the counterfeit version: "Obligation meeting Expectation." It looks like alignment but is actually a "Hidden Contract" building resentment.
Risk Indicator (Section 4.5): SEL is a leading indicator of Volatility Cost. A partner who is "too nice" or "always available" without genuine desire is accumulating "Resentment Debt" that you will have to pay off later.
3. Additional Insight (The Structural / Sovereign Lens)
Emotional Economics (The "Nice Girl" Trap): A woman performing high SEL is engaging in Predatory Altruism. She is trading her autonomy for your validation/safety. In Balance Sheet terms, she is booking "Revenue" (sex happened) while hiding "Liabilities" (pain/boredom/resentment). This creates a Solvency Crisis later in the relationship when she "suddenly" loses attraction or feels used.
Power Dynamics: If a man requires his partner to perform SEL (e.g., needs her orgasm to feel like a man), he has Zero Sovereign Power. He is dependent on her performance for his identity. Safe, polarity-rich relationships require the woman to be "Selfish" enough to own her pleasure, relieving the man of the duty to "manage" her experience.
The "Managerial" Lover: SEL turns the woman into a "Sex Manager," constantly adjusting the dial to keep the "Employee" (you) happy. This kills polarity. You want a Surrendered Devotee, not a Human Resources Manager in the bedroom.
4. Actionable Insight (Bias-to-Action)
The "Compliance Test" (Inverse Screen): When dating, view "Over-Accommodation" as a Red Flag, not a feature.
Observation Heuristic:
Does she stop if something is slightly off? (Good = High Agency)
Does she verbalize preferences without being asked? (Good = Owns her pleasure)
Does she "perform" noises or reactions that feel disconnected from the mechanics? (Bad = SEL)
Script for Calibration (Early Dating): Explicitly frame safety around her pleasure to see if she drops the mask.
"I'm selfish. I only enjoy it if I know you aren't faking it for my ego. If it hurts or is boring, stop. I don't need to be protected."
Watch her reaction. If she looks relieved, she was performing. If she looks confused, she might be authentic.
Unfair
0:00
The transition from manager to director can really
0:02
feel unfair.
0:03
And it's because you can be a top
0:05
performer at your tier, but invisible at the
0:07
next one.
0:08
You got to understand that directors are not
0:10
just better managers, but they are a different
0:14
type of thinker.
0:15
And the thinking that worked for you before
0:17
will eventually work against you.
0:20
What most professionals don't realize is that an
0:22
organization is an ecosystem.
0:23
And as the scope increases, when you become
0:26
director, the leaders who thrive are the ones
0:29
who can thrive in that type of ecosystem,
0:31
but also elevate it.
0:32
And most professionals when they are making the
0:35
transition to manager director, most of them fail,
0:39
not for the lack of skill, but because
0:40
of a lack of systemic perspective.
0:42
In this video, I'm going to talk about
0:44
the professional growth that senior leaders need to
0:47
see in order to trust you with director
0:49
level scope by expanding your jurisdiction.
Growth #1: Expanding Your Value Through Leverage
0:52
The first growth that senior leaders need to
0:54
see is growth in your value, your value,
0:57
because at the manager level, the value is
1:00
in your work in terms of the output
1:02
you have, in terms of the responsibilities that
1:05
you uphold, in terms of the speed and
1:07
efficiency in which you execute, and in terms
1:09
of your understanding of how you solve problems
1:12
directly and ineffectively.
1:14
Because think about it.
1:14
When you're a manager, you are a lot
1:16
of your responsibilities are keeping the business running
1:19
smoothly.
1:19
And oftentimes they are behind the scenes.
1:22
So this is the value as a manager,
1:24
but you see a lot of managers have
1:26
high income skills because they're educated.
1:28
They have a lot of work experience and
1:29
that counts for something, but you know what?
1:32
They're high income skills that they're under leveraged
1:35
in their impact.
1:37
And this is the growth in your value
1:38
that they want to see at the director
1:40
level.
1:40
The value is not in your work.
1:42
The value is in your leverage.
1:44
So leverage Archimedes said it best when it
1:47
comes to a definition of leverage.
1:49
Archimedes said that, and it's his principle.
1:51
He said that if you give me a
1:52
lever long enough and a fulcrum strong enough
1:55
to lay that lever upon and a ground
1:57
to stand on, then I can move the
1:59
whole world.
2:00
And that's leverage.
2:01
Essentially what leverage gives you is that it
2:04
gives you maximum output or payoff you can
2:06
provide for your company, but it's minimum input
2:09
from you.
2:10
And that's the thing because the value is
2:12
not in your work.
2:12
It's in your leverage.
2:14
So while managers are busy focusing on their
2:17
output, managers or directors are very astute at
2:21
finding leverage so that they're not the ones
2:23
that are executing on that output directly, but
2:26
it multitudes.
2:27
The output is in multiply.
2:29
It multiplies in that output.
2:31
While managers are busy solving problems directly, directors
2:34
understand, well, it's not about me rolling up
2:38
my sleeves and being in the trenches, solving
2:40
problems directly, but I'm here to give leverage
2:43
and guideline in understanding what do these problems
2:46
matter?
2:47
What are the problems we are solving?
2:49
Not the problems we think we're solving, not
2:51
symptoms, but what are the problems, the root
2:53
problems that we are solving and which ones
2:55
are the ones that will move the needle.
2:57
So you see finding leverage, that's the value
2:59
in terms of the work of a director
3:02
and thinking at a higher altitude.
Growth #2: Building Leadership Capacitance
3:04
The second thing that senior leaders need to
3:07
see to trust you with director level scope
3:09
is they want to see growth in your
3:11
capacitance.
3:12
Now notice I said capacitance and not capacity.
3:16
Here's the difference.
3:17
In physics, capacitance is the ability of a
3:20
circuit to store energy through a capacitor and
3:23
that energy is deployed later on for greater
3:25
output.
3:26
Now, in a leadership context, your capacitance is
3:30
a measure of your ability to be able
3:32
to operate and navigate the complexities and the
3:35
energetics of higher level roles.
3:37
Now, capacitance is important because the greater your
3:41
capacitance is, the measure of your ability, the
3:44
greater your capacity.
3:46
And you see, you want to have increased
3:49
capacity to become a director.
3:51
You also want to have greater skills.
3:53
You also want to have greater output, increase
3:56
in ability, and you realize that in order
3:58
to get there, you need to increase your
4:00
potential.
4:01
But if you think about it, ability potential
4:03
is limited to your capacity.
4:07
And your capacity is shaped by your capacitance,
4:09
which is a measure of your ability.
4:12
Because if you think about it, potential is
4:14
a form of energy.
4:15
It's called potential energy.
4:16
So if you increase your capacitance, you increase
4:19
the energy you store for greater levels of
4:21
complexity and navigating higher level roles.
4:24
And therefore you can increase your ability.
4:26
Now it's possible that you don't increase your
4:28
capacity at all.
4:29
If you, if you, if your capacitance stays
4:31
the same, you can still increase your ability,
4:34
but up to a certain point.
4:35
And that's why it's possible for an individual
4:38
to increase their capacity, but their potential remains
4:42
capped.
4:43
There's a ceiling on their potential, right?
4:44
You can reflect on that.
4:45
And that's exactly why, if you notice that
4:47
there's a ceiling on the potential or on
4:49
a person's potential, then the clue, the sign
4:52
there is now to increase your capacitance.
4:55
Now what is the capacitor?
4:56
I mentioned that in physics, capacitance is the
4:59
ability of a circuit to store energy through
5:01
a capacitor.
5:03
So what is your capacitor?
5:04
If you think about the circuit, a capacitor
5:06
is a device that's made up of two
5:08
metal plates in parallel like this.
5:10
The plates aren't touching, but they're parallel like
5:12
my hands are.
5:13
Now there's a space in between these two
5:16
plates and the spacing in that's in between
5:19
these two places is really important is because
5:21
the role of the person who's managing that
5:24
circuit is to increase the capacitance of the
5:27
capacitor.
5:27
And one way to do that is to
5:29
change what's between the two plates.
5:32
Right?
5:32
So for example, you can put between the
5:35
two plates, a piece of glass, or you
5:38
can put water between the two plates, or
5:40
you can keep them as air.
5:42
And each of these materials has a different
5:44
dielectric constant.
5:45
So when you change the dielectric, you change
5:48
the level, the amount of energy that that
5:51
capacitor can store.
5:52
So what does that tell you?
5:53
Well, what is that space between the plates?
5:55
It's basically environment between the spaces, the environment.
5:59
So your capacitance, one of the first things
6:02
to increase your capacitance is to change the
6:05
environment.
6:05
So what do I mean by the environment?
6:07
I'm talking about your internal and your external
6:09
environment.
6:10
So begin with your internal environment, which was
6:12
your internal core.
6:13
What is that made up of?
6:15
Well, they're your thoughts.
6:17
They are your life philosophies.
6:19
They're your beliefs.
6:20
They are the assumptions you've been making.
6:22
They're your perspectives, how you feel about certain
6:24
things, your attitudes, all of these things make
6:27
up your internal core.
6:28
So change your internal core to increase your
6:30
capacity.
6:31
That's your internal environment.
6:32
And you have a hundred percent control over
6:34
your internal environment.
6:35
Now, if you're finding it very difficult to
6:38
change your internal core, I don't blame you.
6:40
It's a difficult journey to be on to
6:43
change the beliefs you've had all your whole
6:45
life, or to become aware of what needs
6:48
to be changed.
6:49
It's not an easy feast and it is
6:51
very difficult because the internal work was always
6:54
the hardest.
6:55
But here's the thing.
6:56
If you desire, in case you desire to
6:59
change your internal core, the first step to
7:01
go is to change your external environment first.
7:04
Because, well, you heard the phrase that you
7:06
are the sum of the five closest people
7:07
that you spend the most time with.
7:09
And in many ways, that's true, right?
7:11
You might be spending a lot of time
7:13
with friends.
7:14
You might be spending a lot of time
7:15
reading on the internet, reading the news, updating
7:18
yourself on what's going on out there.
7:20
And all of these things shape your external
7:22
world.
7:22
And no doubt, whether you realize it or
7:24
not, they go on to influence what you
7:27
believe the things you assume they go on
7:30
and they shape your attitudes and your perspectives
7:32
as well, unbeknownst to you.
7:34
So change your external environment.
7:36
And the way, the best way to do
7:38
that is to spend your time with mentors,
7:40
with individuals who were already thinking at a
7:43
higher altitude, to be able to begin with
7:46
the beginner's mind and learn from them, to
7:48
really observe how they talk, observe how they
7:52
make decisions, and to spend time and have
7:54
them mentor you as well, to really change
7:56
your external environment virtually and immediately in your
8:00
physical distance.
How to Increase Your Capacitance (Environment, Surface Area, Distance)
8:01
So that's the first thing is the dielectric.
8:03
Increase and change your environment to increase your
8:06
capacitance.
8:06
That's step number one.
8:08
Another way to increase the capacitance of a
8:11
capacitor, I mentioned there's two plates, right?
8:13
Another thing you can do is you can
8:15
make the size of the two plates a
8:17
lot bigger.
8:18
So when you make them bigger, like imagine
8:20
if my hands got bigger like this, right?
8:22
If you make the plates bigger, essentially what
8:25
you're doing is you're increasing the surface area
8:27
of the plates.
8:28
So how does that translate to you, your
8:30
capacitor?
8:31
So that means increase the surface area.
8:34
What does that mean?
8:35
It means to have more coverage, right?
8:37
Cover more area in your knowledge, cover more
8:40
area in your impact, cover more area in
8:44
the depth of your understanding, cover more area
8:47
in your influence.
8:48
At the end of the day, it goes
8:50
back to your influence.
8:51
When you increase your surface area, you're increasing
8:54
the breadth of your influence and therefore the
8:58
depth and the breadth of your impact.
9:00
And that is a way to increase your
9:01
potential and also your capacitance.
9:04
The third way to increase your capacitance is
9:07
the most effective way that I can share
9:09
with you.
9:10
Let's go back to the capacitor.
9:11
I'm going to use my hands again.
9:13
Remember the first thing we talked about changes
9:15
the environment between the two plates, your environment,
9:17
internal, external.
9:18
The other thing was to increase the surface
9:20
area.
9:21
The third thing you can do in a
9:22
capacitor is to make the plates closer together.
9:25
So draw them closer together, bring them closer
9:27
together.
9:28
So what does this mean in your capacitor?
9:30
It means to shorten the distance.
9:32
So what does that, what distance, right?
9:34
There are three distances that you can shorten,
9:36
and this is the most effective way to
9:38
increase your capacitance.
9:39
The first distance to shorten is the close
9:43
the power gap, right?
9:45
The power gap distance.
9:46
So what does this mean?
9:47
It means like close the power gap between
9:48
you and your senior leaders, between you and
9:51
the key decision makers, between you and the
9:53
stakeholders, between you and individuals who are influential,
9:58
between you and individuals who are politically savvy,
10:01
who really understand the human ecosystem, close the
10:04
gap.
10:04
So this means that for you, it's developing
10:08
the acumen to communicate effectively, to build trust
10:12
and strong connections, to be able to communicate
10:14
with diplomacy and to really understand why people
10:17
do what they do.
10:19
Why did they respond that way?
10:20
So that you can create fair exchange with
10:22
individuals and build equity in your relationships.
10:25
So close the power gap.
10:26
That's number one.
10:27
The second thing in terms of shortening the
10:30
distance is to shorten the vision to execution
10:33
gap.
10:34
So here's what I mean by that.
10:35
You work for a company and your company
10:37
has a vision.
10:38
It could be a five year vision, a
10:40
10 year vision, a generational vision.
10:43
And it's important that you yourself understand what
10:46
the vision is because you're involved in executing
10:49
on that vision and helping that vision to
10:52
become real, helping it to come to fruition
10:56
sooner rather than later.
10:57
So then help, this is like closing the
11:00
vision to execution gap.
11:01
What can you do to close that gap?
11:03
Now that's the vision for the company.
11:05
On the flip side of that, simultaneously, I
11:07
hope anyways that you also have a vision
11:10
for your own life, that you also have
11:12
a vision for your career in the future,
11:13
that you also have a vision of the
11:15
impact you want to have.
11:16
What's your vision, your individual vision and the
11:19
vision you have for your family, of course.
11:21
So then close the gap between the vision
11:23
and execution on that.
11:25
You have a vision.
11:26
If you don't, and it's wise to clarify
11:27
that, then how can you execute on that?
11:29
So the gap is closing.
11:30
So that's the second gap and you close.
11:32
Let's talk about the third gap.
11:34
Now this gap is my favorite.
11:36
What other gap?
11:37
Well, close the knowledge gap.
11:39
You see, there's, I have no doubt that
11:42
you're educated, that you are a lifelong learner,
11:45
that you do a multitude of things every
11:47
day to learn new things.
11:49
That's just a collection of knowledge.
11:50
That's just like data collection, information collection.
11:54
What are you going to do about it?
11:55
Close the knowledge gap.
11:56
So in this case, I'm talking about the
11:59
transition between manager and director, which means that
12:02
it would be wise to close the gap.
12:04
How fast and how soon can you master
12:07
what's needed to be a director?
12:09
How fast can you master, how soon are
12:12
you going to commit to mastery of the
12:14
things that are needed so that you can
12:15
become the one that senior leaders trust to
12:18
expand the scope of your influence.
12:21
So close the gap, your mastery gap to
12:24
the director level roles.
12:25
If moving from manager to director is genuinely
12:28
on your professional goals, then I really do
12:31
invite you to think at a different level
12:33
because directors are not just simply better managers.
12:36
They are different thinkers altogether.
12:39
And if you have been focusing very much
12:41
on learning new skills and to be able
12:44
to increase your knowledge and being able to
12:46
understand the business that you're in, then don't
12:49
sell yourself short because it is about increasing
12:52
your capacity.
12:53
It is about becoming the person who senior
12:56
leaders can trust and also becoming the person
12:59
that when you get to the director level
13:01
role that you can be successful in it
13:03
and thrive in it.
13:04
And perhaps director level role is not where
13:06
you want to stay at, but you want
13:07
to grow further and increase your impact at
13:09
that level.
13:10
So then if that is what you desire
13:13
to achieve for yourself and your career path,
13:15
then I invite you to work with me.
13:17
Below this video on the first link is
13:19
an opportunity for you to speak with one
13:20
of my trusted career advisors and it's really
13:23
to explore whether or not we can really
13:24
support you in your goals in directorhood and
13:28
really exploring, well, what are the assets that
13:30
you have that you're bringing to the table?
13:32
What are you noticing that is preventing you
13:33
from being able to achieve those director level
13:36
roles?
13:37
And if you are the right fit, we'll
13:38
invite you into my mentorship.
13:40
And in my mentorship it really is focusing
13:42
on these things, the growth in your value,
13:45
the growth in your capacitance as well.
13:48
And more importantly is developing yourself from the
13:51
inside out, being in an environment from the
13:53
outside in that supports that type of growth
13:55
at scale.
13:56
So if you are serious about achieving this
13:59
growth for yourself, click the link below and
14:01
I look forward to supporting you as your
14:03
mentor on the inside.
Growth #3: The Logic Senior Leaders Trust
14:05
The next area of growth that senior leaders
14:07
need to see in you is growth in
14:09
your logic.
14:10
You see, when it comes to the being
14:13
successful transitioning to the director level role is
14:16
not about your output or your effort or
14:19
your ability to solve problems that they're testing.
14:21
They already assume that that's, that's the minimum
14:23
level.
14:24
They already assuming that you have to have
14:25
that, but what they're really testing is the
14:28
logic you use to assess the reality around
14:31
you and whether or not leaders can trust
14:33
your logic.
14:34
So here's what I mean by that as
14:36
a director, oftentimes in your environment, just by
14:39
virtue of management itself, you're working with bounded
14:43
logic.
14:44
In other words, you have goals that have
14:46
been set.
14:47
They are known and over time, they're quite
14:49
stable.
14:50
Those are the goals.
14:51
You also have processes and SOPs that you
14:53
work in within.
14:54
I mean, you might make some improvements to
14:56
it, but more or less there are there
14:57
known processes and SOPs, right?
15:00
Not to mention that you have certain variables
15:03
that are given to you.
15:04
For example, like your KPIs, metrics, projects like
15:07
that, like variables that are more or less,
15:10
they, they're, they're a set amount of variables,
15:12
right?
15:12
So this is like the managerial environment and
15:15
you work within it.
15:16
Some improvements can be made.
15:18
Sometimes there are changes in pivots, but more
15:20
or less it's bounded.
15:21
Like that's what it is.
15:22
And it's expected and you know it and
15:25
it's clearly communicated.
15:26
But you see at the director level position,
15:29
not only is your scope broadening, it requires
15:33
a different level of thinking, especially because now
15:36
you're working with ill bounded logic.
15:39
They're ill structured.
15:41
For example, timelines are incomplete and they can
15:44
be conflicting with each other, right?
15:47
Processes are unknown because you're heading into new
15:49
territory and you are thinking visionary timelines out,
15:53
which is, which you can't even see it
15:54
yet.
15:55
You can't even feeling it yet.
15:57
A lot of things at the director level
15:58
role you're pioneering because we need to make
16:01
pivots and we need to make the kind
16:03
of pivots that affect the whole organization.
16:05
So they're very ill bound, right?
16:07
Variables are unknown and they're constantly changing and
16:11
the complexities and the interdependencies between all of
16:14
these and in internal, internal to all of
16:17
these is forever increasing.
16:19
And that's why it's not the same thing.
16:23
Ill bound versus bound structured versus ill structured.
16:28
And that the nature of that environment when
16:31
you're operating in director level scope requires a
16:35
different type of thinking than you had when
16:38
you were a manager.
16:39
And that's why the type of thinking in
16:41
manager, when the environment was more structured and
16:44
more bounded with that logic that invites bounded
16:47
logic, that is going to work against you
16:50
in the director level role.
16:52
Let's go a little bit deeper into the
16:54
logic.
16:54
I've had a lot of comments on my
16:56
videos from viewers asking for examples and asking
16:58
me to go deeper into things.
17:00
So I'm responding to that.
17:01
So let me give you one example of
17:03
the type of logic that is the difference
17:06
between managers and directors.
Deductive vs. Probabilistic Thinking
17:07
The first difference is that there's deduction versus
17:11
probabilistic thinking.
17:13
Now, when you're a manager transitioning into a
17:15
director, you've got to transition away from deduction
17:17
and towards probabilistic thinking.
17:19
So here's what I mean by that.
17:21
Managers often rely on deduction, right?
17:24
When the premises are true, then the conclusion
17:26
follows.
17:27
And that's as simple as that.
17:30
But you see at the director level with
17:31
that scope and that degree of complexity, the
17:34
premises are rarely ever fully true.
17:37
In fact, the premises are either incomplete.
17:42
They are either lagging.
17:44
They are either politically bound.
17:47
They are either they filtered through other people's
17:50
perspectives and politics.
17:51
They can be bound by context.
17:53
They may be partially true.
17:55
They may be completely unknown.
17:57
So that's why at the director level, it's
17:58
a completely different thinker, right?
18:00
They are never fully true.
18:02
And this is why instead of relying on
18:04
deduction, the directors operate on probabilistic thinking because
18:08
at the director level, even when premises are
18:12
rarely ever fully true, directors must still make
18:16
decisions and act decisively.
18:18
And that's the true challenge.
18:20
So now I'll give you some examples, right?
18:23
Very often I work with senior level managers
18:25
who have a lot, many years of experience,
18:28
highly educated, and they're being groomed to become
18:31
directors.
18:32
They don't have the title yet.
18:34
They haven't had interviews yet, but you know,
18:36
that's the direction they want to go.
18:38
And one or two of their senior managers
18:40
have told them that, you know, they should
18:43
be groomed for that.
18:44
So they're hopeful.
18:45
And when I work with them and I
18:47
have conversations with them, I see a pattern
18:49
all across the board and this is it.
18:52
It's deduction.
18:52
It's deduction thinking where generally managers ask a
18:57
common question and the common question they ask
18:59
is, is this correct?
19:01
Am I doing this correct?
19:03
Is this right?
19:04
And that's deductive thinking because as the premises
19:06
are true, the conclusion will follow.
19:08
Now, probabilistic thinking is different.
19:10
Now, first of all, is this correct?
19:12
It makes sense at the manager level because
19:14
you're working with well-defined problems and you're
19:18
working with clear bounded logic.
19:22
But at the director level, remember, most things
19:25
are never fully true.
19:26
So you really can't ask, is this correct?
19:29
Because, well, I don't know.
19:30
It depends on who you ask.
19:31
And I don't know if it's correct or
19:32
not.
19:33
There's just so much complication.
19:35
There's just too many nuances.
19:36
So probabilistic thinking is very different.
19:39
Instead of working for, instead of looking and
19:42
focusing on correctness, black or white, if the
19:45
premises are true, conclusion follows, it's really looking
19:48
at degrees of confidence, probabilistic thinking, degrees of
19:52
confidence, degrees of certainty, whatever you want to
19:54
call it.
19:55
So instead of asking me if this is
19:56
correct, probabilistic thinking asks, well, how confident are
20:00
we?
20:01
And what would change my mind?
20:02
What would need to happen in order for
20:04
my mind to change?
20:05
And what would happen if I were to
20:06
change my mind?
20:07
That's a very different way of thinking.
20:09
And this thinking is at higher level of
20:11
altitude because you don't need to know the
20:16
correct way to move forward because there isn't
20:18
one.
20:19
But I have a way of systematically thinking
20:23
through my logic to understand reality so that
20:27
I can still be decisive when it matters
20:29
most.
Solving vs. Diagnosing Problems
20:30
The second growth in logic is moving away
20:33
from solving towards diagnostic thinking.
20:37
As a manager, and I see this across
20:39
the board as well, this pattern in terms
20:41
of solving the present problem.
20:43
Because as a manager, sometimes you're presented with
20:46
a problem and you have to solve it.
20:48
Or sometimes you notice a problem through your
20:51
data and then you go in directly to
20:53
solve it.
20:54
And that's really solving problems that are in
20:57
the present.
20:58
And oftentimes when I go in and I
21:00
coach my clients who are senior managers, very
21:02
experienced, what they're really doing is symptoms management.
21:06
Problem presents itself.
21:08
It appears to be a bottleneck.
21:09
The data shows them that this is a
21:11
bottleneck because of X, Y, Z.
21:13
Then they're managing symptoms.
21:14
And then when they give a solution or
21:17
that when they need to get buy-in
21:18
for solution, they justify.
21:19
There's justification, right?
21:21
Directors operate on a totally different altitude.
21:24
They don't solve the problems that present themselves.
21:28
They get to the root cause of the
21:30
problem.
21:30
It's not about, they're solving real problems, not
21:32
the symptoms of the problems.
21:33
They're understanding real drivers.
21:35
They're understanding the best and most simplest explanation
21:38
as a result of the data being presented.
21:41
And they understand how to diagnose the root
21:43
causes.
21:44
Now that takes a higher level of thinking
21:46
because when you're diagnosed, when you're diagnosing root
21:49
causes, you're moving away from the immediate reaction
21:53
of this is a problem.
21:54
We've got to do something about it now
21:55
to, well, hold on, let's think about this
21:58
more because it's not about the problem.
22:00
It's how you think about the problem.
22:01
And then they go into diagnosis.
22:04
And this is important because if you think
22:06
about it, I'll draw the analogy from a
22:09
doctor's perspective, right?
22:11
When you go in and you have a
22:13
patient waiting for you in the examination room,
22:15
I go in, you know, you've got your
22:17
clipboard as a doctor, you go into your
22:18
clipboard.
22:19
What's the first thing you ask the patient?
22:20
You say, well, it seems to be the
22:21
problem.
22:23
And then they tell you a story and
22:25
it's all symptoms.
22:26
Notice, Oh, I have a pain right here.
22:28
And sometimes when I take this medicine, the
22:31
pain goes here.
22:32
Notice that the first thing the patient tells
22:34
you is the symptoms.
22:35
So what does the doctor do?
22:37
The doctor asks more questions.
22:39
And the questions they ask are very educated.
22:42
They're very wise questions that only the doctor
22:45
would have thought of asking these questions.
22:47
Why are they doing that is because they
22:49
want to understand the root problem.
22:52
Why?
22:53
Because a prescription without a proper diagnosis is
22:57
malpractice.
22:59
Now concept applies to you as well.
23:01
If you're a director and you need to
23:03
solve problems, even if you're a senior manager
23:05
and you need to solve problems, are you
23:07
solving the problem directly at an absence of
23:09
a diagnosis?
23:09
Well then that's malpractice.
Induction vs. Inferential Thinking
23:11
The third type of growth in logic comes
23:14
from moving away from inducing alone towards full
23:17
spectrum inferential thinking.
23:20
Inferential thinking is how you make sense of
23:22
the world around you to reach a conclusion.
23:24
And it's based on reasoning.
23:26
Inducing, however, is just one part of inferential
23:30
reasoning where you reach a generalization just based
23:35
out of a few observations.
23:37
Now as managers, and I see this a
23:39
lot, this pattern working with managers, managers have
23:43
a tendency to create general rules just by
23:47
what they observe in a few instances.
23:49
For example, they can observe around their environment
23:52
at work and they make general rules or
23:54
generalizations such as, well, this never happens.
23:58
Or they say this always happens just based
24:00
on a few observations.
24:02
Or sometimes managers make specific observations and they
24:07
also come to a generalization.
24:10
And it sounds, an example of that sounds
24:11
like, well, the project was delayed because of
24:15
X.
24:16
And this is a general rule to say
24:18
that factor X caused the delay in the
24:20
project.
24:21
Now you've got to understand that this type
24:25
of thinking inducing alone, there's limitations on that
24:29
because induction is accurate only if the future
24:33
looks a lot like the past.
24:35
And if you think about it, the economics
24:37
today, the world at large today in your
24:40
life today versus five years ago or 10
24:43
years ago, what ratio was the future similar
24:46
to the past?
24:46
In what ratio?
24:48
So there's problems you see.
24:50
And the other thing is when you reach
24:51
a director level scope, it's a totally different
24:54
way of thinking.
24:55
Directors cannot rely on inducing alone because the
24:59
future does not look a lot like the
25:00
past and because the future is constantly changing.
25:05
So it's not possible to make one generalization
25:08
or a general rule based on a few
25:10
observations or based on a few specific observations
25:13
because it's just constantly changing.
25:17
And there's a lot of difficulty with the
25:19
number of nuances there are and complexities to
25:21
find relationships between these observations.
25:25
Managers have a tendency to build rules from
25:27
patterns because they're focusing on what already exists.
25:30
But when you reach the director level role,
25:33
it's very difficult to operate that way and
25:35
fruit through induction alone because you're going to
25:38
be facing a lot of first time problems
25:40
where no prior pattern existed before.
25:43
And as a result of that, directors do
25:45
something completely different and higher altitude of thinking
25:49
where you'll still see patterns as a director.
25:52
They could be first time patterns.
25:53
A lot of them are.
25:55
So they're going to observe these patterns to
25:57
understand why these patterns exist, but not just
26:01
that.
26:02
Why do they exist?
26:03
And when should they be broken?
26:05
Because when the pattern is broken, now we
26:07
have a sense of direction.
26:08
We can be decisive at what actions we
26:10
need to take.
26:11
And furthermore, as a director, effective directors, their
26:15
logic is multidirectional.
26:18
They have the top down direction where you
26:20
begin with the vision, the vision of the
26:22
whole company, the 10 year vision, the multigenerational
26:25
vision top down.
26:27
And from that, they see the pattern.
26:29
They understand why it exists and what needs
26:31
to be broken.
26:32
The other direction is bottom up.
26:33
When you start from the bottom up, you
26:35
start from data.
26:36
What do you observe there?
26:37
What does the data say?
26:38
What does the evidence say?
26:40
And of course, as I mentioned earlier, the
26:42
data is not always going to be fully
26:44
true, but this is where they look at.
26:47
Well, why does the data exist?
26:48
What is it telling us right now?
26:50
When should it be broken?
26:52
And as a result of that, this type
26:54
of multidirectional logic and all the three types
26:57
of logic I shared before, not just this
26:59
one, but all the different transformations and growth
27:02
and logic patterns, directors are able to solve
27:04
highly complex novel problems by constantly adjusting and
27:10
optimizing, iterating their mental frameworks.
The Internal Operating System That Gets Rejected at the Next Level
27:13
The transition from manager to director is not
27:16
about learning more for the sake of learning
27:18
more.
27:19
And it's definitely not about working harder because
27:21
the managers who rise are not always the
27:23
ones who are working harder than their peers,
27:26
but it is really about becoming more internally,
27:30
your internal environment, the internal character of who
27:33
you are and your abilities because you are
27:36
increasing your capacity.
27:37
Because here's the thing, if you keep your
27:39
current operating system, the one that helped you
27:42
to be successful before and in your previous
27:44
career life, sure, that served you in the
27:47
past and you've reached your success the way
27:50
you are now.
27:51
But if you keep that old operating system,
27:53
then your next level in director level roles,
27:56
it will reject you because the thinking that
27:58
served you before is going to start working
28:00
against you.
28:01
And you're going to realize that when you
28:02
try to expand your scope and you expand
28:04
your influence.
28:05
So this growth is really about your internal
28:08
architecture more than it is about keeping and
28:12
optimizing your old operating system.

I couldn't find your personal_profile.md file (which is used to score relevance against your North Stars). I'll provide an analysis of the content, but without your profile, I can't score it against your specific goals.
📄 Content Analysis
Source: Nature – Scientific Reports (2024)
Title: Women and men with distressing low sexual desire exhibit sexually dimorphic brain processing
📌 Summary
First-ever direct comparison of brain activity between women and men with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD)
~10% of women and ~8% of men are affected by HSDD
Used fMRI on 64 participants (32F, 32M) watching sexual vs. non-sexual videos
🧠 Key Findings
💡 Implications
Sex-specific treatments are needed — the same disorder has different neural signatures in women vs. men
Men with HSDD are frequently misdiagnosed as erectile dysfunction
There are zero approved treatments for male HSDD (vs. two for women in the US)
❓ Relevance Score: Unknown
I need your Personal Profile to score this. If you want me to set one up, say:
"Create my personal profile"
Otherwise, if you still find this valuable, just say "Stack it" and I'll save it to your Google Sheet.
