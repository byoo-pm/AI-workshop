Today, the data is not structured and is not being used to its full potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (1) I think we could be much better at identifying potential customers (prospecting, moving away from sales rep visits only). (2) We could be better at leveraging our data by linking AI and Power BI, in order to make decisions that will impact our P&L.                                                                                                                                I love traveling to other countries, having time to relax, reflect, and reconnect with myself by hiking, swimming, reading, and going to a spa ;). I also love having quality time with my family and kids, finding activities that will help them grow.                                                                                                I really like Italian food because it is obviously always delicious (and often with tomatoes, which I love ;) and I love Asian cuisine for the variety of dishes (especially Thai and Japanese food).

4  2026-02-02T11:56:24.161Z            radu puha  I spend way too much time manually gathering data from different sources to prepare for our Flash reports and Country Product Marketing (SteerCo) meetings.\n\nRight now, I spend about 80% of my time just finding and fixing the data, and only 20% actually analyzing it.\n\nIn an ideal world, an AI would automatically pull, consolidate, and format this data before I even open my laptop. This would allow me to spend my time looking for insights and discussing strategy, rather than building spreadsheets.  In SE Europe, we lack specialized tools to provide an accurate picture of the "right price."If i am correct even existing systems like Salesforce or Anaplan struggle to synthesize the complex interplay between local logistics and value-based pricing.\n\nI propose an AI-powered pricing application (using an AppSheet-style interface) driven by Machine Learning (multiple regressions and/or neural networks). This tool would allow a user to input variables like city, monthly quantity, customer type, product,market segment and asset type to receive instant, multi-scenario pricing options.\n\nHow it works: In the backend, the model would use detailed sales history, logistics data (loading rates), asset pool info, and rotation speed. \nIt would then output four distinct price points:\n\nCost-based: Full cost recovery.\n\nMarginal Cost: Excluding fixed costs for strategic volume.\n\nOpportunity Cost: Factoring in the scarcity of assets (tanks/cylinders).\n\nValue-Added: Accounting for branded product premiums and regional median prices.\n\nThis creates significant P&L impact by moving from subjective pricing to data-driven precision, ensuring we optimize both our margins and our asset utilization across the region.                                                                                                                                          I love traveling, whether it’s a quick local trip or an international adventure. I'm a big fan of the mountains and hiking; there's nothing better than being out in nature and visiting spots that haven't been touched by human development.          I am an absolute foodie, and since I have no restrictions or allergies to any ingredients, I don't have a particular preference on the menu, but I am open to discovering new flavors and cuisines, no matter how eccentric they may seem. I enjoy the social aspect of dining with others.

Ceasars salad or comparable is also fine as a mixture out of vitamines and fun.

Have an integrated pricing tool that prioritizes potential actions for the sales teams in terms of profit growth: 1° for the existing portfolio (both on the aggressive side = smart pricing actions, either as mass PIC or as individual P+ action: what, how, when and also on the protective side: P- to consider for potential churn risk customers or products which are severely overpriced) and 2° for business development: have a deep insight in the volume growth potential per product per market per geography complete with applications and a price guidance that is conducting the proposed selling price window. Completed with competitive intelligence down to the same levels.      It depends: to keep my brain busy, I like reading about history, it's giving me geopolitical and cultural insights because I believe we can learn from the past and the past helps us to understand today. On the other hand: to keep my body busy I like to ride the road race or gravel bike, preferably in the mountains or in hilly regions challenging myself to perform better.   My favorite is the Basque food, because they combine centuries of tradition from both the land and the sea with freshness with creativity. And it's no secret that I like red wines, especially Spanish Rioja wines with tempranillo grape and North-Italian Piemontese wines with nebbiolo grape.

Also the price simulations for each and every reforecast which need to be done in sometimes slow gsheets. And also very very difficult situation with any single SAP update - the most minor operational update requires tens of stakeholders to look at it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         AI shall definitely design plants and scan the existing ones and propose the improvements in operational flow or operator movements. The idea is popular since Henry Ford time, but AI can replace the experts of workplace ergonomy. WU efficiencies = PEX efficiencies. \n\nAI shall operate the ASU playing on the Energy market and optimising the production for min cost. \n\nAI shall book our flight tickets instead of concur for better prices :D\n\nAI shall check the customer's application with its real gas purchase profile (which gases they buy vs what they should need in theory considering their industry) and advice the bundle-deals opportunities. \n\nA very very bad idea, but AI can analyse the screens of office employees, identify the workload per task and prepare workload reports and propose the right organigrams without consultants with their GSheets. Hence, I guess some efficiencies in FTEs can be identified. But I think GDPR will not allow that thing in the EU.                                                                                                                   My perfect Sunday will look like combo of a home-made crepes for breakfast, then a squash play, then some sauna, and some reading of a book on a sofa as a finisher. On holidays I love exploring countries both inside and outside EU, and I quite like Middle East.                                                                                                I eat almost everything. In a restaurant I would go for a pasta as a safe choice, but at home I eat quite some Asian food: my absolute favorite would be rice with a piece of salmon and some kimchi.

Could be nice to have automatic tool to answer underlying profitabiloity and reasoning of LY/LM deviation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          automatic daily volume by customer explanation with trends based on last month. Today daily volume is always a delta between CY and LY (2026 vs 2025) with no trendline from last months. first would be great to see this (maybe even to Customer detail) but as well to predict future daily based on last months history (and compare to LY).
