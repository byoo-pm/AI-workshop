Helium: important gas for Industries, Healthcare and Semiconductor ---
‹#›
Liquid Helium is the only cost-effective way to achieve near absolute zero (4.2 Kelvin or -269°C) economically

It is critical for MRI and NMR, with no commercial substitute below ten Kelvin.

Logistics are vital due to "boil-off" in specialized, time-sensitive shipping containers.

Supply is a volatile byproduct of specific Natural Gas (LNG) geological formations.

Key markets include Healthcare (MRI), Semiconductors, R&D, Space Industry, Balloons, Cutting & Welding, …

Safety 
How an MRI works
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) creates 2D or 3D images of the body.
A powerful, stable magnetic field is required for this process.
Liquid helium is necessary to cool superconducting magnets below 10 Kelvin.
The loss of superconductivity is called a 'quench'.

Helium: Critical, Constrained, Complex ---

Safety 
Helium: Critical, Constrained, Complex
A rare structural failure occurred on July 16, 2025, in a Chinese hospital's MRI scanner.

The Siemens MAGNETOM Skyra 3.0T machine experienced a loud bang and physical damage.

This was a unique structural failure, not a typical superconducting magnet "quench."

Siemens issued a recall notice on August 20, 2025, following the investigation.

The incident emphasizes the need for rigorous safety and maintenance protocols.

1 liter of Liquid Helium expands to roughly 700-750 liters of gas.

For all the teams: 
Securing Target 2026 Balancing Volume & Pricing
3 identified levers to do so : limit churn,  push for growth and further smart pricing actions (retention in bulk leveraging new flexible clauses, further criteria to use for Price campaign in PG).  
Medgas integration
Align (expansion and diverses other streams)
Continue to foster collaboration within the team, with entities, other cluster teams, SWE and WBL. 
Accelerate on AI usage

What did I learn in 2025?
Organisation changes are heavy, I dedicated a very significant amount of my time in H1 2025 to design the organisation and solve HR topics >> It was worth it. Because before we are an organization, we are people—each with our own talents and strengths, but united by a common drive to progress and collaborate.
H2 2025: the relief ! Now we are starting and we were able to bring everything together: 
Full deployment of monthly business performance steerco > positive feedback so far
Good collaboration within the teams and in our own direct team (interactions between you guys!)
Impression to bring added value to the entity from a strategic perspective
Still missing a bit the more operational business topics 

What are the challenges I will face in 2026?
Find the right balance between products/ volumes >> I am not used to it ! or it is far far away
Learn to say no more often and be able to better protect my agenda, I should be the “owner” of my time
Continue to progress thanks to personal coaching (Korn Ferry program)
Feel confident, stay pragmatic, close to the “field”
Protect my work-life balance (kids are only little once in a lifetime)

For CSE+PL teams (and Marek): 
BG+RO Adapt (not only new scope for ppl but the same tools implementation),
ALign PL implementation with CSE countries for data preparation,

E2E Profitability BOS tool (maybe with the same allocation key for CSE+PL?)
PT/Vol balance with PG loading for PL and RO new FP’s. 

What did I learn in 2025?
Suddenly, I stopped putting out fires myself and started teaching others how to build fire prevention systems.
I noticed that my old local role was pulling me back into daily operations. I’ve since learned to balance my Polish market expertise with a broader focus, ensuring I provide strategic value to the entire Cluster, not just my home ground (it will be still one of the biggest challenges in 2026…).
I focused on being a supportive partner (buddy) rather than just a boss. I think that in a complex team structure, you can't just give orders. Instead, I’m trying build trust and influence by giving enough time to others (sharing my expertise).

What are the challenges I will face in 2026?
Move more ! sitting too much … 
Get more ‘real’ Market perspective (spend more time on-site with Sales Team on quarterly meetings, not only Poland).
Start bringing proposals for profitability improvement (the most difficult from helicopter view).
Establish direct lines of communication with local Product Marketers (outside CSE+PL) to identify and replicate successful case studies across geographies (“Best Practice Factory”) with focus of ‘small wins’.
Economic situation with competition volume focus.

C2P Achievements 2025
C2P v5 evolution implemented
(Re-)Onboarding
(Re-)Onboarding & Training various European Teams:
Training KU & Training the Bulk/PG Product Marketers & Pricing Teams owning the (monthly or yearly) cost data
Sales Teams able to understand the C2P KPI’s, to navigate in the C2P report,  to follow up results and being able to identify actions which lead to growth of the profitability of their portfolio
New training materials constructed and provided
C2P Target Setting re-implemented in Bonus schemes

Monthly variable Cost updates for Primary Bulk Sources! 
Previous cost model with all-year long flat and stable cost of gas for Bulk Sources has been abandoned -> Sales and Costs are aligned.
New C2P cost model for Bulk Sources is based on a Monthly variable cost, based on the underlying Energy cost
With a correlation between the Variable Bulk Source cost and the Energy indexed Bulk Molecule Sales Price, depending on the Energy index definition in the Sales Contract, allowing up to three different Bulk Unit Costs values (based on YAH forward E, DAH spot E or Mix/PPA E).
New KPI’s introduced in the C2P reports!
Cost Inflation Impact and Indicative Passthrough Impact parameters
New screens displaying the new KPI’s and the relation between these KPI’s and the delta C2P
Algorithm Evolution
New 2ndary PG Transport Cost formula developed!
Improving C2P outcome, making the cost model better fit with the actual transportation costs
Comes with a more transparent calculation methodology of the coefficients used in the algorithm
Tested with all NCE entities

--- Slide 36: C2P Roadmap 2026 ---
C2P Roadmap 2026
‹#›
Priority #1 = ROBUSTIFICATION !
Address systemic C2P data quality and calculation instability
Cost Upload Governance process: reinforce local cost data ownership and comprehension + implement Salesforce evolution with Cost visualization and historization, allowing quick fix corrections by local data owner (Product Marketing/Pricing Teams) without intervention of DATA & AI
Structured monthly verifications of C2P report output to create trust, including a formal "Reconciliation" mapping C2P calculation rules directly against GM/OIR/Sales Variance Analysis definitions.
Address C2P performance issues in WAVE
Deal with the slowness
Architectural shift required: move heavy data calculations from the report side to the data cloud side, and work on the CDM by having C2P variable cost in the European CDM. This ensures that the "data cube" is processed before it ever reaches the sales rep's screen.
Improve the visuals by avoiding data overload in the C2P report and reducing navigational complexity
Priority #2 = EXPANSION !
Prepare expansion to AL Austria, AL Poland, AL UK and also to MedGas
Data preparation: scoping, mapping, grouping, IT accesses
Cost Model Alignment 
NEW by Q2 2026: MedGas Expansion
NEW by Q3 2026: Country Expansion  
Countries for C2P Expansion after 2027

--- Slide 37: Roadmap of 2026 ---
Roadmap of 2026
‹#›
C2P Pricing Solution priorities: 
Hypercare - hypercare… Build Trust & Improve Outcomes by implementing Hypercare: master the cost data, clarifying price impact vs. price effect, cost inflation impact vs. Operations control cost inflation, and indicative passthrough vs. Operations control passthrough.
Enhance Data Quality: Improve input data quality for costs and strengthen links with other databases (e.g., LED/ALTO).
Streamline Business Process: Provide quick and easy access to historical monthly bulk cost data.
Simplify Visuals: Simplify PowerBI visuals for C2P, shifting from data overload in tables to more impactful infographics.
C2P Expansion: Simultaneously work on the C2P Expansion to MedGas, ALAustria, ALPoland, and ALUK, which includes gap analysis, scoping, data preparation, cost model alignment, and UAT.

What did I learn in 2025?
Team & Networking: Great experience being part of a new team, reconnecting with familiar faces (Lisa, Byunghui, Melanie), and meeting very interesting new colleagues from whom I can still learn.
Pace vs. Stability: I am a fast learner, but need to moderate my ambition and slow the pace of new feature introduction to the C2P tool. I learned the hard way that the C2P tool's stability was lower than anticipated, making robustification the 1st priority
Gemini Potential: Learned the fantastic capabilities of Gemini, I am planning to leverage it more in 2026

What are the challenges I will face in 2026?
Stakeholder Happiness & Trust: 
Goal = to Prevent Amandine from getting any grey hair due to C2P and ensure that Paul Krafft is a happy stakeholder!
Challenge = Building trust in the C2P outcome is crucial, especially as all Sales Teams now have C2P targets in their Bonus Schemes, which will inevitably lead to challenges (rightful or not).
Resource Management: Find and retain human resource support on the DATA & AI side to handle the extensive workload. 
Expand internal connectivity beyond my primary interactions (Bulk & PG Product Marketers / Pricing Leads) to the wider team + Connect with all local NCE organizations to establish the same level of effective interaction as with the former NEC entities

Medium and Large consumers:
Logistics savings do not offset liquefaction overcosts

Extra large customers (2 tpd):
Logistics savings could offset liquefaction overcosts


Very limited opportunities of identifying very large customers close to LH2 sources and far from gaseous ones 
+ Need to invest in LH2 tanks
Industrial Merchant



2 tpd corresponds to the size of HRSs for the heavy duty segment that the H2E WBL expects to supply in a few years. LH2 could decrease total landed costs for such very high customers depending on their distance from the sources.

Need of large autonomy / continuity of supply
‹#›
The large autonomy of LH2 tanks represents a value for EL customers

ENHANCE would improve the reliability of the LH2 Supply in Europe

In addition, the new 30 tpd liquefier of AP in Rozenbourg, should also contribute positively to the AL EL BCP in case of Waziers breakdown.

--- Slide 53: Conclusion on LH2 ---
Conclusion on LH2
‹#›
The current analysis indicates that investing in a larger H2 liquefier would not significantly benefit the IM/EL business lines. This is because IM and EL customers' H2 consumption levels are insufficient to take advantage of the increased payload offered by larger liquid hydrogen trailers. Conversely, relocating the European LH2 source to Rotterdam would not adversely affect the existing LH2 operations of the IM and EL business lines.


In order to achieve the target volumes of the mobility market, H2E must be present in the heavy duty segment that will rely on large refuelling stations (1-2 tpd). Supplying such stations with GH2 will be feasible in a very limited area around our GH2 sources (100-150 km) using a significant number of large 300b trailers. For more distant or larger stations, it will not be possible with a 300b GH2 supply chain.

--- Slide 59: Proposed strategy ---
Proposed strategy
‹#›
Purchase type 2 300b to replace old 200b trailer when they reach their regulatory requalification due date. 
→ will bring saving thanks to larger payload
Order 5x type 4 trailers to OP Mobility to launch the development of this cheaper solution that will end up to much cheaper large type 4 trailers mainly for the mobility market 
If new customers justifie investment in large type 4 before the availability of the new (cheaper) units, purchase type 2 to free up large units from contracts of customers that do not fully justify type 4 assets

--- Slide 60: New 300b trailers purchase governance ---
New 300b trailers purchase governance
‹#›
Move from a project-specific CAPEX request for new trailers to a clear split between "large H2-bulk offers" and "H2-trailers asset management”. Instead of embedding the CAPEX request for new trailers in the CPR note related to a specific project, there will now be a dedicated CAPEX request for trailers, triggered by a low buffer level (at the discretion of the NCE H2 leader who also has a European mandate).

For public tenders, which represent a major part of H2E activity, there will be a single A+C CPR note. This considering the public tender model doesn't give the possibility of negotiation after submission of the binding offer, and therefore no need to close the loop post-offer before signing the contract (no gap between Gate A and Gate C).

For large H2E projects (multi-year project, demand >5 trailers), for which negotiation are expected (for instance TEAL), the H2E steam will still have to go through the complete CPR process i.e. Gate V, then A, then C, and the CAPEX request will remain attached to the project Note. This should remain the exception rather than the norm though.
